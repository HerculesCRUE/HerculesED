The workspace has not been sufficiently explored as<br>\nspace where everyday appliances and work equipment might<br>\nbe converted into persuasive devices which raise eco-awareness.<br>\nIn this paper, we present the design of persuasive IoT devices<br>\nthat help to promote energy-efficient behaviour change in the<br>\nworkplace. This approach issued by applying Grounded Theory<br>\nanalysis over qualitative data collected at ten focus groups<br>\nsessions after running a one year study where participants<br>\nwere treated to different persuasive strategies. With these data,<br>\nfive design categories emerged to be taken into account in<br>\nthe conception phase when devising tangible objects that aim<br>\nto form pro-environmental behaviour change at workplaces.<br>\nOur design-insights are also derived from an evaluation of the<br>\nliterature on ambient devices that encourage energy-efficient<br>\npractices.</p>",
