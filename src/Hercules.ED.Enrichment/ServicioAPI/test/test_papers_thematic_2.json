    "abstract": "Laboratory experiments were carried out to determine the effects of exposure to different concentrations of As, Hg, Sb and Se on photosynthetic and respiratory rates and on photosynthetic efficiency in the aquatic bryophyte Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw. Specimens of the moss, collected from a clean site, were incubated in solutions of As, Hg, Sb and Se (at concentrations ranging from 0.1 μg l−1 to 10,000 μg l−1) for up to 22 days. The photosynthetic and respiratory rates were then determined by the light/dark bottle technique, and the photosynthetic efficiency was measured by the saturation pulse method. Although different responses were observed in relation to the concentration of the elements, clear responses in net photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency were generally only observed in the moss exposed to the highest concentrations of these elements in solution. Mercury was apparently the most toxic of the elements studied. Net photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency were also related to tissue concentrations of these elements in the moss. Despite the higher toxicity of Hg, this element can be accumulated at high concentrations in moss, probably at",

Bryophytes 1 Introduction In this study, we investigated the physiological effects of arsenic, mercury, antimony and selenium in the aquatic moss Fontinalis antipyretica. These elements, which are all toxic at relatively low concentrations, have different (if any) functions in living organisms. Selenium is a micronutrient in many taxonomic groups, although it is not essential for plants (Schrauzer 2004). Data obtained in different studies suggest that As is also an essential element in many living organisms, although this has not yet been corroborated (Stoeppler 2004). Antimony and Hg have no known function in living organisms (Drasch et al. 2004; Rish 2004). All of these elements occur naturally in fresh water, usually at low concentrations (<10 μg l−1 for As and Se, and only a few nanograms per litre for Sb and Hg) (Koch et al. 1999; Drasch et al. 2004; Rish 2004; Schrauzer 2004; Stoeppler 2004). However, they can be found at much 1659, Page 2 of 14 higher concentrations in certain areas as a result of natural or",
