    "abstract": "Laboratory experiments were carried out to determine the effects of exposure to different concentrations of As, Hg, Sb and Se on photosynthetic and respiratory rates and on photosynthetic efficiency in the aquatic bryophyte Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw. Specimens of the moss, collected from a clean site, were incubated in solutions of As, Hg, Sb and Se (at concentrations ranging from 0.1 μg l−1 to 10,000 μg l−1) for up to 22 days. The photosynthetic and respiratory rates were then determined by the light/dark bottle technique, and the photosynthetic efficiency was measured by the saturation pulse method. Although different responses were observed in relation to the concentration of the elements, clear responses in net photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency were generally only observed in the moss exposed to the highest concentrations of these elements in solution. Mercury was apparently the most toxic of the elements studied. Net photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency were also related to tissue concentrations of these elements in the moss. Despite the higher toxicity of Hg, this element can be accumulated at high concentrations in moss, probably at",
    "body": "In this study, we investigated the physiological effects of arsenic, mercury, antimony and selenium in the aquatic moss Fontinalis antipyretica. These elements, which are all toxic at relatively low concentrations, have different (if any) functions in living organisms. Selenium is a micronutrient in many taxonomic groups, although it is not essential for plants (Schrauzer 2004). Data obtained in different studies suggest that As is also an essential element in many living organisms, although this has not yet been corroborated (Stoeppler 2004). Antimony and Hg have no known function in living organisms (Drasch et al. 2004;Rish2004). All of these elements occur naturally in fresh water, usually at low concentrations (<10 μgl −1 for As and Se, and only a few nanograms per litre for Sb and Hg) (Koch et al. 1999; Drasch et al. 2004;Rish2004; Schrauzer 2004; Stoeppler 2004). However, they can be found at much Water Air Soil Pollut (2013) 224:1659 DOI 10.1007/s11270-013-1659-1 S. Díaz :A.

Vázquez Ecología, Escuela Politécnica Superior, Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, Lugo, Spain e-mail: ruben.villares@usc.es higher concentrations in certain areas as a result of natural or anthropogenic sources. For example, high concentrations of arsenic (10–5,000 μgl −1 )havebeen detected in hot spring waters (Kanamori and Sugawara 1965; Miyashita et al. 2009), and high concentrations of Sb (more than 150 μgl −1 ) have been measured in rivers in some mining areas (Fu et al. 2010). Aquatic bryophytes have been used for many years to biomonitor water pollution (e.g. Empain 1973; Wehr and Whitton 1983; Cenci 2000; Cesa et al. 2009). The moss F. antipyretica is one of the species most com- monly used for biomonitoring as it is widely extended in the northern hemisphere, has been shown to accu- mulate different contaminants at high levels and alter- ations in its physiology are known to be good indica- tors of water quality (Vázquez et al. 1999; Cenci 2000; Fernández et al. 2006). Thus, the effects of variables such as organic pollution (Martínez-Abaigar et al. 1993; Vázquez et al. 2013), temperature (Carballeira et al. 1998), metals such as Cd and Cu (Sommer and Winkler 1982), wood ash solution (Aronsson and Ekelund 2006), ammonium (Vieira et al. 2009)and desiccation (Cruz de Carvalho et al. 2011) have been studied in relation to photosynthesis and/or respiration in F. antipyretica. Stress also affects the chlorophyll fluorescence yield in plants (Branquinho et al. 1997a, b; Lichtenthaler and Miehe 1997), although few stud- ies have dealt with this parameter in the species under consideration (Rau et al. 2007). In the present study, we aimed to determine how exposure of F. antipyretica to As, Hg, Sb and Se affected several physiological variables: net photosyn- thetic and dark respiration rates and photosynthetic efficiency. The results obtained will increase our knowledge of the physiological effects of these ele- ments and the risks associated with their presence at different concentrations in aquatic systems. This will also enhance the usefulness of this moss with a view to extending its application to assessing the quality of fresh water. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Plant Material Moss samples were collected from an unpolluted site in the upper reaches of the river Lérez (Galicia, NW Spain). There is no industrial activity in the upper river basin and the population density is low in this area. The initial concentrations of As, Hg, Sb and Se in these samples were 1,680, 0.978, 199 and 483 ng g −1 ,respec- tively. These concentrations are similar to or lower than those reported for aquatic mosses from clean sites or concentrations cited as background levels (Roeck et al. 1995; Carter and Porter 1997; SEPA 2000; Nimis et al. 2002; Pekka et al. 2008; Culioli et al. 2009;Cesaetal. 2010; Gapeeva et al. 2010). Only plants submerged to a certain depth were collected to avoid those that might have suffered stress by being emerged for a prolonged period (Wehr and Whitton 1983). The samples were rinsed on site with river water and transported to the laboratory in a portable refrigerator (5±2 °C). In the laboratory, the plants were carefully washed with dechlorinated water to remove epiphytes and debris. All experiments were performed with 2-cm-long apices to minimize errors due to variations in the accumulation capacities of different plant parts (Wehr and Whitton 1983; Wells and Brown 1990). 2.2 Experimental Conditions The moss samples were incubated in glass tanks with 5 l of each of the following solutions of As, Hg, Sb and Se: 0 (control), 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 μgl −1 , prepared from standard solutions of, respectively, As 2 O 5 , Hg(NO 3 ) 2 , SbCl 3 and SeO 2 (Merck and Panreac). The different dilutions were prepared with tap water (the characteristics of which are shown in Table 1) filtered through activated carbon. During the incubations, the water wasaerated continuously by means of an air pump. All experiments were carried out in a cool chamber at 16±0.1 °C, with a 12:12 h day/night cycle (light intensity 80 μmol photons m −2 s −1 ). Aliquots of the moss samples were removed from the solutions after 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16 and 22 days, and the physiological variables and the element concentrations were determined as explained below. The aliquots used to measure the physiological variables were discarded and were not returned to the tanks, i.e. repeated measurements were not made on the same apices over time. 2.3 Determination of Elemental Concentrations The element concentrations in mosses were determined from 300±5 mg apical tissue samples, which were digested with nitric acid at high temperature and high pressure, as previously described (López and Carballeira 1659, Page 2 of 14 Water Air Soil Pollut (2013) 224:1659 1993; Wehr and Whitton 1983). The concentrations of As, Sb and Se were determined by atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (PSA Excalibur). The concentration of Hg was determined by atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (PSA Merlin Plus). For analytical control of the process, samples of certified reference material (European Community Reference Bureau No. 61: Rhynchostegium riparioides, an aquatic moss) were analysed at the same time as the other samples. 2.4 Determination of Physiological Variables The net photosynthesis and dark respiration rates were determined by the light/dark bottle technique. Twenty apical segments of about 2 cm in length (approximate- ly 0.05 g dw) were placed in each bottle (Karlsruhe, WTW KF-12, 0.31 l) and the bottles were incubated for 4 h at 16±0.1 °C and a light intensity of 80 μmol photons m −2 s −1 . The oxygen concentration was mea- sured in each bottle before and after the assay with a shaking-head polarographic oximeter (Oxi96, WTW). At the end of the assay, the apical segments were dried at 105 °C to enable calculation of the dry weight. Photosynthetic efficiency was evaluated by chloro- phyll afluorescence, a non-invasive technique. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were measured by the saturation pulse method (Schreiber et al. 1995) with a portable fluorometer (PAM-2000 photosynthesis yield analyser; Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany). A pulse of saturating light (>5,000 μmol photons m −2 s −1 ,0.8s pulse length, actinic white light) was applied through a fibre optic cable at an angle of 60° relative to the sample and at a distance of 12 mm from the moss surface. Prior to measurements, excess water was blotted from the moss and samples were dark-adapted for 20 min. This length of time is considered to be sufficient to allow all photosystem II (PSII) reaction centres to open (Fracheboud and Leipner 2003). Four replicate moss samples per treatment were then analysed to determine the maximum quantum yield of PSII as the ratio of F v /F m =(F m −F 0 )/F m (Bolhàr-Nordenkampf et al. 1989), where F 0 and F m are, respectively, the minimal and maximal fluorescence yields of a dark-adapted sample, with all PSII reaction centres fully open (i.e. all primary acceptors oxidized). The F v /F m ratio indicates the effi- ciency by which the excitation energy is captured by open photosystem II reaction centres and represents the fraction of incident photon energy that is processed photochemically (Butler and Kitajima 1975; Krause and Weis 1991). This ratio, which is considered valuable in ecophysiology and stress physiology, decreases under stress conditions (Lichtenthaler and Miehé 1997; Csintalan et al. 1999). Unfortunately, the fluorometer broke down during the process of the study, thus preventing us from obtaining the data for Se. However, we think it is useful to present the results for the remaining elements. 2.5 Statistical Analysis The relationships between the physiological variables and the independent variables concentration in water and time were modelled by multiple regression: linear and loga- rithmic fits were tested and the most significant fit was selected. If the fit for either of the independent variables was not significant, the variable was omitted from the analysis and a new fit was tested with the remaining independent variable by means of the curvilinear regres- sion option of the IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software. The relationships between the physiological variables and the tissue concentrations were modelled in the same way. 3 Results 3.1 Effects on Net Photosynthetic Rate Thephotosyntheticratesareexpressedaspercentages, calculated relative to the control for the same incubation Table 1 Characteristics of the water used in the experiments.

This procedure corrects for the “transplant ef- fect,”i.e. stress caused by relocation of specimens and by the laboratory conditions under which the experiments were performed. The response of net photosynthesis (NP) in relation to the concentration of the elements in solution varied depending on the element considered (Fig. 1). For Hg, this physiological parameter tended to decrease from low concentrations in solution. For As, the NP values were similar to the control values in the range 0.1 to 100 μgl −1 and were lower at higher concentrations of the element. For Se, there was also a clear decrease in the NP at the higher concentrations. Unusual behaviour was observed for Sb, with an increase in NP at concen- trations of 100 and 1,000 μgl −1 , and a decrease at 10,000 μgl −1 . Although these data indicate a relation- ship between exposure concentration and photosynthetic rate, the effects were most evident at very high exposure concentrations (1,000–10,000 μgl −1 ), which are not usually found in natural environments. However, for Hg, the relationship was manifested from lower concentrations. The multiple regressions for NP in relation to the exposure concentration and time were established by taking into account all of the data for Hg because as already mentioned, it was the only element for which the NP values decreased continuously with increasing exposure concentration. For the other elements, which appeared to display a threshold response, only the final exposure concentrations were fitted. In all cases, time was not a significant variable (Table 2), and therefore, the fits were repeated by considering only the exposure concentration as an independent variable (Fig. 1). The most satisfactory fits were generally obtained with logarithmic equations, except for As, for which a in- verse equation was most appropriate. The median effective solution concentrations (i.e. the concentration of the element in solution that caused a 50 % reduction in net photosynthesis with respect to the control, EC50 w ) were calculated from these regressions. The EC50 w values followed the order Hg<As<Se≪Sb. The relationship between NP and the tissue concen- tration of each element is shown in Fig. 2.Fromthe -20 20 60 100 140 180 0.01 1 100 10000 NP as % of control  Water As (µg  l-1)  y = 29.31+ (7483/x)  R2 = 0.653  p<0.001  EC50w = 362 µg l-1  y = -11.083Ln(x) + 103.37  R2 = 0.6578  p<0.001  EC50w = 124 µg l-1  -50 0 50 100 150 200 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 NP as % of control  Water Hg (µg  l-1)  y = -65.245Ln(x) + 567.9  R2 = 0.7717  p<0.001  EC50w = 4935 µg l-1  -100 -50 0 50 100 150 200 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 NP as % of control  Water Sb (µg l-1)  y = -22.46Ln(x) + 200.43  R2 = 0.7152  p<0.001  EC50w = 811 µg l-1  -100 -50 0 50 100 150 200 0.01 1 100 10000 NP as % of control  Water Se (µg l-1)  Fig. 1 Net photosynthetic rate (NP) of F. antipyretica previously exposed to different concentrations (0.1 to 10,000 μgl −1 ) of As, Hg, Sb and Se in solution; the results are expressed as a percent- age of the control value. Black diamonds represent the median values for each exposure concentration. The median effective solution concentrations for NP (EC50 w ) calculated from regres- sion equations are also shown 1659, Page 4 of 14 Water Air Soil Pollut (2013) 224:1659 regression equation that best fitted the data, we calcu- lated the median effective tissue concentrations (EC50 t ), i.e. the concentrations of an element in the moss causing 50 % inhibition of NP with respect to the control. Best fits were achieved with logarithmic equations for As, Hg and Sb, and linear equation for Se. The fits for Hg and Se were better, and the coefficients of determination for As and Sb were quite low, although significant. The order of EC50 t values was Se<As<<Hg<Sb. 3.2 Temporal Changes in the Net Photosynthetic Rate In the moss samples exposed to As in solution, the NP decreased clearly over time only at the highest expo- sure concentration (Fig. 3). There was no evident trend, even at exposure to 1,000 μgl −1 of As, although the NP was almost always lower than in the control. For the other concentrations, the NP values were similar to the control values. In the samples exposed to Hg, the NP values were similar to control values for exposure concentrations of up to 10 μgl −1 . In samples exposed to 100 μgl −1 of Hg, and particularly 1,000 μgl −1 , the NP decreased over time, and the values became negative for the longest exposure times. At the highest exposure concentration, and after an initial increase, the NP remained constant and negative. At this concentration, the moss appeared completely deteriorated from the first day of incubation, so that the value obtained may indicate a stressful situa- tion with lethal effects. In fact, in laboratory studies, Samecka-Cymerman and Kempers (1995) calculated that the lethal concentration (24 h LC100) of Hg for the liverwort Scapania undulata was between 500 and 1,000 μgl −1 , i.e. within the same range of concentrations Table 2 Fits obtained by multiple regression for net photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency (F v /F m ) in relation to the exposure concentrations and exposure times Coefficients Sig.

For Sb, a decreasing trend in NP over time was only notable at 1,000 μgl −1 , whereas the effect of the maximum exposure concentration was similar to that observed for Hg. In the case of Se, there was no clear pattern, and the NP values were similar to controls at the first four concentrations. In the samples exposed to 1,000 μgl −1 , there was a sharp decrease in NP between first and second day of incubation, with constant values thereafter. At 10,000 μgl −1 , the response was similar, but with lower values of NP. 3.3 Effects on Dark Respiration Rate Unlike net photosynthesis, the dark respiration (DR) rates were not clearly related to the exposure concentra- tion. Although the median value tended to decrease, no clear trend was observed, as occurred in the case of the NP, and the values were very variable (data not shown). For As and Sb, the temporal changes in the DR for each exposure concentration were similar, with an initial increase in DR and a subsequent decrease. The initial increase, also observed in the NP, may be due to the stress suffered by the moss at the beginning of the exposure period. The moss then appeared to acclimatize to the new situation, which led to a delayed decrease in DR, and stabilization at values similar to control values for lower exposure concentrations. At the highest con- centrations, the decreases were much more pronounced, probably because the physiology of the moss was seri- ously affected. For Hg, a clear trend was only observed at 10,000 μgl −1 , and there was a gradual decrease in respiratory rates, probably due to damage to the moss physiology and its subsequent death. The most clearly defined pattern of dark respiration rates was observed in moss samples exposed to Se, with values tending to increase with increasing time of exposure, which prob- ably reflects the increased physiological stress over time. For the highest concentration, after a rapid initial increase, the values stabilized at levels well below the controls, probably indicating severe physiologica"
