    "title": "Robust Homomorphic Video Hashing",
    "abstract": "The Internet has been weaponized to carry out cybercriminal activities at an unprecedented pace. The rising concerns for preserving the privacy of personal data while availing modern tools and technologies is alarming. End-to-end encrypted solutions are in demand for almost all commercial platforms. On one side, it seems imperative to provide such solutions and give people trust to reliably use these platforms. On the other side, this creates a huge opportunity to carry out unchecked cybercrimes. This paper proposes a robust video hashing technique, scalable and efficient in chalking out matches from an enormous bulk of videos floating on these commercial platforms. The video hash is validated to be robust to common manipulations like scaling, corruptions by noise, compression, and contrast changes that are most probable to happen during transmission. It can also be transformed into the encrypted domain and work on top of encrypted videos without deciphering. Thus, it can serve as a potential forensic tool that can trace the illegal sharing of videos without knowing the underlying content. Hence, it can help preserve privacy and combat cybercrimes such as revenge porn, hateful content, child abuse, or illegal material propagated in a video.",
    "text": "The unprecedented growth in the rate of multimedia capture and transmission technologies is witnessing a massive explosion of data worldwide. According to recent statistics in 2017, every minute of YouTube upload accounts to nearly 300 hours of video upload. The average number of visitors browsing YouTube everyday accounts to nearly 30 million. Facebook, the biggest social media site, has a daily average of 8 billion video views from around 500 million users. Given the massive growth of online videos, retrieval of efficient videos is a challenging task. The design of a fast and efficient content-based search for videos is very challenging compared to images. A video has a complex, diverse pattern of high-level information across the frames like action recognition, event detection, etc. apart from the low-level information contained within the frames [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Even a small snippet of a video needs massive computational resources to extract a signature that can be used for mapping across the vast repository of the available videos. The development of an efficient framework that can facilitate fast retrieval of relevant videos for a given query video is a challenging research problem. Videos are more susceptible to security and privacy breaches as they carry both absolute and contextual information. They may lead to serious consequences if the video carries any confidential information. Upcoming news about privacy losses has already alarmed society. Hence, end-to-end encryption based solutions are in high demand. Maintaining the utility of the solutions and addressing security and privacy concerns is a challenging research area. Homomorphic encryption is a class of encryption schemes that allows operations on the encrypted content but is computationally quite expensive. Catering the problem of the videos with this homomorphic encryption tool becomes even more challenging",
